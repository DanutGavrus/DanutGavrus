### ⚡ Fun facts / Know me better
I enjoy using Linux more than Windows on my personal laptop 🤷🏻‍♂️  
I took the 1st place in 11th & 12th grades at the math olympiad - county phase, but my scoring was not high enough to advance to the country phase 😔  
I copied my answers wrong from the scrap paper to the official paper during the simulation of the grid exam at the University of Computer Science in Cluj-Napoca, otherwise I would have been in the first 10 people which would have been accepted as students without having to later on take the admission exam. I got over it, and later on, I entered among the first 1-2% places 😁  
I was also in the first 1% places for high school's admission with an average entrance grade of 9.92 🤓  
I contested the grade of 9.85 taken in the baccalaureate's math exam 🫣  
I want to be part of the people who make the community better, so I tried being part of a political party once, and actually went with a basketball court project to the city's mayor. It was implemented years ago in my hometown, it's about 14m length and 7.5m wide, and it's still freely used in the central park 🏀  
I like working on personal projects in my spare time. I have created a big speaker of ~120cm length and ~50cm height from scratch, and it stays connected to my TV using Bluetooth for some years now 🔊

Here are some photos of the speaker and the basketball court if you want to see any 📷:
