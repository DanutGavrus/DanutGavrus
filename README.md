### ⚡ Fun facts / Know me better
- I've been chosen as one of the 3 Employee Representatives in the previous company, and I've started new initiatives such as: donating old hardware, monthly team buildings, employee's quarterly budget for extra activities, etc.
- I want to be part of the people who make the community better, so I tried being part of a political party once, and actually went with a Basketball Court project to my city's mayor. It was implemented in 2015, it's about 14m long and 7.5m wide, and it's still freely used in the central park.  
- I enjoy using Linux(Fedora as of now) on my personal laptop.  
- I like being creative and working on personal projects(IT and non IT related) in my spare time. I have made a Stereo Speaker of ~120cm length and ~50cm height from scratch, and it has been staying connected to my TV using Bluetooth for some years now.  
- I took 1st place in 12th grade and 2nd place in 11th grade in the Mathematical Olympiad's county phase, and Honorable Mention in 12th grade in the annual "Traian Lalescu" Mathematical Competition's intercounty phase.
